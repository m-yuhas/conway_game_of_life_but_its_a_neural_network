# Conway's Game of Life, but It's a Neural Network
Because if something is worth doing, it's worth doing on a GPU

**TLDR;** It's difficult to write a pretty function to play Conway's game of life game without using a double for-loop and a bunch of conditionals, so why not implement it as a CNN with a custom kernel and activation function instead!
